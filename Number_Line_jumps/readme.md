## Problem Description

You are choreographing a circus show with two kangaroos on a number line. The first kangaroo starts at position `x1` and moves at a rate of `v1` meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at position `x2` and moves at a rate of `v2` meters per jump. Determine if it's possible for both kangaroos to land at the same location at the same time.

### Input Format
Four integers representing:
- `x1`, `v1`: Starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
- `x2`, `v2`: Starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2

### Constraints
- 0 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 10000

### Output Format
Return "YES" if they can land at the same position at the same time, otherwise return "NO".

### Sample Input 1

0 3 4 2


### Sample Output 1
YES
